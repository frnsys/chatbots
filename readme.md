# Journalism for the Future

**(this syllabus is a work-in-progress)**

<https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/LLSJ3022>

> Chatbots are a way of interacting with a service by "texting" it like you would a friend. They are rapidly becoming a common way to interface with services, including the news. In this course, we'll survey existing chatbots (such as Quartz's news app) and discuss the challenges and implications of conversational user interfaces more broadly (such as Siri and Echo). Students will learn how to build chatbots - by the end of the course, students will have written and deployed their own chatbot. Programming experience is preferred, as students will use Javascript in class. Students will be provided with a brief crash-course on Javascript, but those without some prior experience to programming should be prepared to invest outside time learning the language more proficiently. You must have taken Web Fundamentals or have the permission of the instructor to take this class. This class is taught by Francis Tseng, former Knight-Mozilla Fellow, the New York Times.

This class will consist of short lectures on various aspects of designing and building chatbots and projects where you will write your own chatbots.

We will use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as the medium for our chatbots and develop them using [Botkit](https://howdy.ai/botkit/) (Javascript). We'll use [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) to augment our bots with natural language capabilities, [scrape-it](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/scrape-it) to grab data from websites, and also make use of other APIs.
